### Contributing Code

We welcome code contributions! Here's how to get started:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Set up your development environment** (see [Development Setup](#development-setup))
3. **Make your changes** following our [Code Style Guidelines](#code-style-guidelines)
4. **Write or update tests** to cover your changes
5. **Ensure all tests pass** and the code builds successfully
6. **Update documentation** if you've changed functionality
7. **Submit a pull request** following the [Pull Request Process](#pull-request-process)

### How We Work on Issues (Project Flow)

- **Issues are not assigned by default**: you do not need permission to start work, you can add a comment if you like.
- **Anyone may work on an open issue**: if you want to tackle something, go for it.
- **First high-quality PR may be merged**: if multiple PRs compete, we will likely merge the first one that meets the quality bar.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 22+ LTS (or 24+)
- uv (Python package manager)

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your API keys
```

See [ENVIRONMENT.md](ENVIRONMENT.md) for detailed environment setup.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
./run-backend.sh

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd frontend
npm run electron:dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend unit tests
cd backend
pytest tests/test_unit.py -v

# Backend integration tests (requires running backend)
cd backend
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v

# All backend tests
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
```

See [backend/tests/README.md](backend/tests/README.md) for more testing details.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** - Branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-japanese-support`)
2. **Make your changes** - Keep commits focused and atomic
3. **Write clear commit messages** - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
4. **Update documentation** - Update [README.md](README.md), [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md), or other docs as needed
5. **Test your changes** - Ensure all tests pass and functionality works as expected
6. **Submit your PR** with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description of what changed and why
   - Reference to any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - Screenshots/recordings for UI changes
   - Note if AI assistance was used (see [AI-Assisted Development](#ai-assisted-development))

7. **Respond to feedback** - Be open to constructive criticism and suggestions
8. **Maintain your PR** - Keep it up to date with the main branch

### Required Checks (GitHub Actions)

- GitHub Actions must be green before merge (linting + testing + any other required checks for the PR).
- If your PR changes the frontend, please also run the frontend checks locally (e.g., `npm run lint` and `npm run build`) and mention the results in the PR.
  
For the backend, CI runs Ruff formatting/linting, Pyright type checks, and unit tests. See the workflow: [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

**Note**: Changes to `.github/workflows/**` and `.github/actions/**` require approval from @pkuppens per CODEOWNERS policy.

### PR Review Process

- Pull requests will be reviewed by project maintainers
- We aim to review PRs within a few days, but please be patient
- Feedback will be constructive and aimed at maintaining code quality
- During the PR and before the merge, we require both:
  - **PR submitter responsibility**: you are responsible for reviewing any AI-generated code before submitting, and for addressing review feedback.
  - **Maintainer reviews**:
    - **AI-assisted review**: maintainers may use AI tools during review. If you used an agent, please include prompts/notes so we can follow the reasoning.
    - **Human maintainer review**: a maintainer approval on the PR
- Once approved and all checks pass, your PR will be merged by a maintainer

By contributing, you agree that maintainers may apply small edits during review or as part of the final merge (for example to fix formatting, tests, or clarity).

### Pull Requests Are a Commitment Signal

Opening a PR is the start of a contribution. To keep the project moving, maintainers may close PRs that:

- are clearly incomplete without a plan,
- stall without communication, or
- stay inactive for a while.

If you need more time, just leave a short comment with your timeline — that's usually enough.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python (Backend)

- **Follow PEP 8** - Python style guidelines
- **Use type hints** - Add type hints for function parameters and return values
- **Write docstrings** - Use clear docstrings for classes and functions
- **Line length**: 100 characters (configured in ruff)
- **Formatting**: Run `ruff format` before committing
- **Linting**: Run `ruff check` and fix any issues

Example:
```python
def calculate_difficulty_level(text: str, current_level: str) -> str:
    """
    Calculate the appropriate CEFR difficulty level based on text complexity.
    
    Args:
        text: The input text to analyze
        current_level: The user's current CEFR level (A1-C2)
    
    Returns:
        The recommended CEFR level as a string
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- **Use TypeScript** - Leverage type safety
- **Functional components** - Use React functional components with hooks
- **Clear naming** - Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Component structure** - Keep components focused and single-purpose
- **Props interfaces** - Define interfaces for component props

Example:
```typescript
interface ConversationProps {
  targetLanguage: string;
  cefrLevel: string;
  onMessageSent: (message: string) => void;
}

const Conversation: React.FC<ConversationProps> = ({ 
  targetLanguage, 
  cefrLevel, 
  onMessageSent 
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### General Guidelines

- **Keep functions focused** - Each function should do one thing well
- **Write self-documenting code** - Use clear names that explain intent
- **Add comments sparingly** - Comment the "why", not the "what"
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Provide meaningful error messages
- **Test edge cases** - Consider and test boundary conditions

## AI-Assisted Development

**AI-assisted coding is welcomed and encouraged!** We recognize that AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, and others can significantly boost productivity and code quality.

### Guidelines for AI-Assisted Contributions

1. **Disclosure**: When submitting a PR that used AI assistance, please mention it in the PR description
   - Example: "AI-assisted: Used GitHub Copilot for boilerplate code generation"
   - Example: "AI-assisted: Used Claude to help design the error handling logic"

2. **Agentic coding is encouraged**: if you used an agent (or multiple tool calls / iterations), please paste:
   - the key prompt(s) you used, and
   - a short summary of important decisions (what you accepted/rejected and why)

   Put this in the PR description or comments so reviewers can follow the reasoning.

3. **Submitter Review Required**: All AI-generated code MUST be:
   - **Reviewed** - Carefully reviewed by a human before submission
   - **Understood** - Fully understood by the contributor
   - **Tested** - Thoroughly tested to ensure it works correctly
   - **Adapted** - Modified as needed to fit the project's style and requirements

Maintainers will also review AI-assisted changes before merge (see [PR Review Process](#pr-review-process)).

4. **Quality Standards**: AI-assisted code must meet the same quality standards as any other contribution:
   - Follows our code style guidelines
   - Includes appropriate tests
   - Has clear documentation
   - Handles errors properly
   - Is maintainable and readable

5. **What to Avoid**:
   - Don't blindly copy-paste AI-generated code without understanding it
   - Don't submit large AI-generated blocks without review and testing
   - Don't rely on AI for critical security-related code without extra scrutiny
   - Don't use AI-generated code that may have licensing issues

### Why We Embrace AI Assistance

- **Productivity** - AI can help write boilerplate, tests, and documentation faster
- **Learning** - AI can suggest patterns and approaches you might not have considered
- **Quality** - AI can help catch bugs and suggest improvements
- **Innovation** - We believe in using the best tools available to build better software

We trust our contributors to use AI responsibly and maintain high-quality standards.
