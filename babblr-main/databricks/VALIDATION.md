# Databricks Tutorial - Validation Plan

> **GitHub Issue**: [#72 - Databricks Learning Analytics Tutorial](https://github.com/pkuppens/babblr/issues/72)

This document provides a comprehensive validation strategy and checklist for verifying the Databricks tutorial works correctly end-to-end.

## Validation Strategy

### Goals

1. **Functional Validation**: Verify all notebooks execute without errors
2. **Data Validation**: Confirm data flows correctly through Bronze → Silver → Gold layers
3. **User Experience Validation**: Ensure a complete beginner can follow the tutorial
4. **Use Case Validation**: Verify the analytics answer real business questions

### Approach

We validate at three levels:

| Level | What We Test | How |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| **Local** | Data generation, file creation | Run scripts locally, inspect outputs |
| **Databricks** | Notebooks, Delta tables, queries | Execute in Databricks workspace |
| **Use Case** | Business value, actionable insights | Role-play as "Training Material Manager" |

### Test Environment

- **Local**: Windows/Mac/Linux with Python 3.11+ (avoid 3.13 for PyTorch/CUDA compatibility)
- **Databricks**: [Free Edition](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/getting-started/free-edition) (serverless)
- **Data**: Synthetic data from `generate_synthetic_data.py`

> **Note**: Databricks Community Edition was [retired January 1, 2026](https://community.databricks.com/t5/announcements/psa-community-edition-retires-at-the-end-of-2025-move-to-free/td-p/141888).
> Free Edition uses **serverless compute** - no manual cluster creation required.

### Key Free Edition Characteristics

| Feature | Free Edition | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Compute | Serverless (managed) | No cluster creation needed |
| Languages | Python, SQL | Scala/R not supported |
| Storage | Unity Catalog Volumes | DBFS root restricted |
| ML | MLflow, Model Serving | GPU support in beta |
| Limits | Daily quota | Resets next day if exceeded |

See: [Free Edition Limitations](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/getting-started/free-edition-limitations)

## Pre-Validation Checklist

Before starting validation, ensure you have:

- [ ] Python 3.12 installed locally (the project uses Python 3.12)
- [ ] [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed (the project's package manager)
- [ ] Backend dependencies installed: `cd backend && uv sync`
- [ ] [Databricks Free Edition account](https://www.databricks.com/product/faq/community-edition) created
- [ ] All files from the `databricks/` folder available
- [ ] At least 2 hours available for full validation

> **Note**: The `pandas`, `pyarrow`, and `numpy` packages are included in the backend's `pyproject.toml` and will be installed by `uv sync`.

---

## Part 1: Local Validation

### 1.1 Data Generation Script

**Goal**: Verify `generate_synthetic_data.py` creates valid data files.

```bash
# Run from the backend directory to reuse the uv environment
cd backend
uv run python ../databricks/generate_synthetic_data.py --output-dir ../databricks/data
```

> **Note**: The data generation dependencies (`pandas`, `pyarrow`) are included in the backend's `pyproject.toml`.

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Script runs without errors
- [ ] Script prints progress messages
- [ ] `databricks/data/` folder is created (if not exists)
- [ ] All 7 parquet files are created:
  - [ ] `databricks/data/conversations.parquet`
  - [ ] `databricks/data/messages.parquet`
  - [ ] `databricks/data/lessons.parquet`
  - [ ] `databricks/data/lesson_progress.parquet`
  - [ ] `databricks/data/assessments.parquet`
  - [ ] `databricks/data/assessment_attempts.parquet`
  - [ ] `databricks/data/user_levels.parquet`
- [ ] Total file size is approximately 150-200 KB
- [ ] Running script again with same seed produces identical files

**Data Spot Checks** (run from the backend directory):

```bash
cd backend
uv run python -c "
import pandas as pd

# Check conversations
df = pd.read_parquet('../databricks/data/conversations.parquet')
print(f'Conversations: {len(df)} rows')
assert len(df) > 400, 'Expected 400+ conversations'
assert 'user_id' in df.columns
assert 'language' in df.columns
assert df['language'].nunique() == 6, 'Expected 6 languages'

# Check messages
df = pd.read_parquet('../databricks/data/messages.parquet')
print(f'Messages: {len(df)} rows')
assert len(df) > 2000, 'Expected 2000+ messages'

# Check assessments catalog
df = pd.read_parquet('../databricks/data/assessments.parquet')
print(f'Assessments: {len(df)} rows')
assert len(df) == 144, 'Expected 144 assessment definitions'

# Check assessment attempts
df = pd.read_parquet('../databricks/data/assessment_attempts.parquet')
print(f'Assessment attempts: {len(df)} rows')
assert len(df) > 150, 'Expected 150+ attempts'

print('All local data checks passed!')
"
```

- [ ] All assertions pass
- [ ] Row counts match expected ranges

### 1.2 Notebook File Validation

**Goal**: Verify notebook files are valid JSON, can be opened, and have correct structure.  
**Note**: This section only validates file structure and syntax. Actual execution testing happens in Part 2 (Databricks Validation), as these notebooks require Databricks runtime and storage.

**Checklist**:

- [ ] `01_bronze_layer.ipynb` opens in VS Code/JupyterLab without errors
- [ ] `02_silver_layer.ipynb` opens without errors
- [ ] `03_gold_layer.ipynb` opens without errors
- [ ] `04_dashboard.ipynb` opens without errors
- [ ] Each notebook has markdown cells with explanations
- [ ] Each notebook has code cells with Python/SQL code
- [ ] Python code syntax is valid (can be checked with a linter or syntax checker)
- [ ] No `# MAGIC` or `# COMMAND ----------` syntax remains (Databricks format)
- [ ] Notebooks are ready for import into Databricks (valid JSON structure)

> **Note**: These notebooks are designed to run in Databricks and will not execute successfully locally due to dependencies on Databricks runtime (Spark, Delta Lake, Unity Catalog). Execution validation is performed in Part 2.

### 1.3 README Validation

**Goal**: Verify documentation is complete and accurate.

**Checklist**:

- [ ] README.md renders correctly on GitHub (or in VS Code preview)
- [ ] All internal links work (e.g., #troubleshooting)
- [ ] Prerequisites section lists all requirements
- [ ] All code blocks have correct syntax highlighting
- [ ] Folder structure matches actual files
- [ ] No broken external links

---

## Part 2: Databricks Validation

### 2.1 Account and Serverless Compute Setup

**Goal**: Verify Databricks Free Edition environment is ready.

**Documentation**: [Sign up for Free Edition](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/getting-started/free-edition)

**Account Creation Checklist**:

- [ ] Navigate to [databricks.com](https://www.databricks.com/)
- [ ] Click "Try Databricks Free"
- [ ] Sign up with email, Google, or Microsoft account
- [ ] Verify email if required
- [ ] Workspace URL is accessible (e.g., `https://dbc-xxxxxxxx-xxxx.cloud.databricks.com/`)

**Workspace Verification**:

- [ ] Can log into Databricks workspace
- [ ] Workspace loads without errors
- [ ] Left sidebar shows: Workspace, Catalog, Workflows, Compute, etc.
- [ ] Unity Catalog is enabled (it is by default and it is required for serverless)

> **Note**: Unity Catalog is Databricks' modern data governance system. The **Catalog** menu item in the sidebar is the UI for Unity Catalog. Unity Catalog provides a centralized metastore for managing data, tables, and permissions. In Free Edition, Unity Catalog is enabled by default and required for serverless compute. You can verify it's enabled by checking that the Catalog menu is visible in the sidebar, or by running `SELECT CURRENT_METASTORE();` in a notebook (should return a metastore ID, not empty).

**Serverless Compute Verification**:

> **Note**: Free Edition uses [serverless compute](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/serverless/notebooks) -
> you don't create clusters manually. Databricks manages compute for you.

**Steps** (create a new notebook to test serverless compute):

1. Click **Workspace** in the sidebar
2. Right-click a folder (or create a new folder) → **Create** → **Notebook**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "test-serverless") and click **Create**
4. The notebook opens automatically
5. Click **"Connect"** dropdown (top-right of notebook)
6. Select **"Serverless"** option
7. Compute starts within 30 seconds (no 5-10 min cluster startup)
8. Run a simple test cell: `print("Serverless compute is working!")`

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Can create a new notebook
- [ ] Notebook opens in the Databricks editor
- [ ] **"Serverless"** option is available in the Connect dropdown
- [ ] Can connect to Serverless compute
- [ ] Compute starts within 30 seconds
- [ ] Test code cell executes successfully

### 2.2 File Upload

**Goal**: Verify data files can be uploaded.

**Documentation**: [Import notebooks](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/notebooks/notebook-export-import) | [Upload to volumes](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ingestion/file-upload/upload-to-volume)

**Notebook Import Checklist**:

- [ ] Click **Workspace** in sidebar
- [ ] Right-click folder → **Import** (or use kebab menu → Import)
- [ ] Can import all 4 `.ipynb` notebook files
- [ ] Notebooks appear in the folder after import
- [ ] Can open each notebook in the Databricks editor
- [ ] Can connect notebooks to **Serverless** compute

**Data Upload via Unity Catalog Volumes** (required for medallion architecture):

> **Documentation**: [Work with files in volumes](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/volumes/volume-files)  
> **Free Edition**: This tutorial uses **local file uploads** to Unity Catalog Volumes (not external AWS/S3 volumes). The typical catalog name in Free Edition is `workspace`.  
> **Best Practice**: Unity Catalog Volumes are required for Spark to access data files. They support large files (up to 5GB per file) and are designed for production data workloads.

**Steps**:

1. Click **Catalog** in sidebar
2. Navigate to or create catalog (typically `workspace` in Free Edition, or `main`/`hive_metastore` if available)
3. Create schema: Click catalog → **Create** → **Schema** → name it `babblr`
4. Create volume: Click schema `babblr` → **Create** → **Volume** → name it `bronze`
5. Click into the `bronze` volume
6. Click **"Add"** or **"Upload"** button
7. Upload all 7 parquet files locally (max 5GB per file, but our files are ~150-200KB total):
   - `conversations.parquet`
   - `messages.parquet`
   - `lessons.parquet`
   - `lesson_progress.parquet`
   - `assessments.parquet`
   - `assessment_attempts.parquet`
   - `user_levels.parquet`
8. Files appear in `/Volumes/<catalog>/babblr/bronze/` (replace `<catalog>` with your catalog name, typically `/Volumes/workspace/babblr/bronze/` in Free Edition)

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Catalog exists (typically `workspace` in Free Edition)
- [ ] Schema `babblr` is created
- [ ] Volume `bronze` is created
- [ ] All 7 parquet files are uploaded locally (not external AWS/S3)
- [ ] Files are visible in the volume

> **Important**: Workspace folders **cannot** be used for Spark data access. Spark cannot read parquet files from Workspace folders due to access restrictions. You **must** use Unity Catalog Volumes (see instructions above).  
> **Note**: The notebook UI upload typically places files in `/tmp/` which is temporary storage. For persistent medallion architecture, use Unity Catalog Volumes as described above.

### 2.3 Notebook 01: Bronze Layer

**Goal**: Verify raw data ingestion works.

**Pre-conditions**:
- Connected to Serverless compute (click **Connect** → **Serverless**)
- Data files are uploaded to Unity Catalog volume
- Notebook is open in Databricks editor

**Execution Checklist**:

- [ ] Cell 1 (Setup): Runs without errors
- [ ] Correct storage path is detected and printed
- [ ] Database `babblr_bronze` is created
- [ ] Cell 2 (List files): Shows all 7 parquet files
- [ ] Cell 3 (load_to_delta function): Runs without errors
- [ ] Cell 4 (Load all tables): All 7 tables load successfully
- [ ] Output shows row counts for each table:
  - [ ] `conversations`: 400+ rows
  - [ ] `messages`: 2000+ rows
  - [ ] `lessons`: 50+ rows
  - [ ] `lesson_progress`: 800+ rows
  - [ ] `assessments`: 144 rows

## Part 3: Use Case Validation

### Use Case: Training Material Manager

**Persona**: Sarah, a Training Material Manager at Babblr. She needs to identify which lessons and assessments need improvement based on student performance data.

**Goal**: Validate that the analytics pipeline provides actionable insights for improving training materials.

### 3.1 Scenario: Identify Underperforming Lessons

**Task**: Find lessons with low completion rates or low mastery scores.

**Steps**:

1. Open notebook 04 or run SQL directly
2. Execute the lesson effectiveness query

**Validation Queries**:

```sql
-- Find lessons with completion rate below 60%
SELECT
    lesson_type,
    subject,
    lesson_difficulty,
    total_attempts,
    ROUND(completion_rate * 100, 1) as completion_rate_pct,
    ROUND(avg_mastery * 100, 1) as avg_mastery_pct
FROM babblr_gold.lesson_effectiveness
WHERE completion_rate < 0.6
ORDER BY completion_rate ASC;
```

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Query executes without errors
- [ ] Results show lessons with low completion rates
- [ ] Can identify specific subjects that need attention
- [ ] Can compare performance across lesson types (vocab, grammar, listening)
- [ ] Data supports decision: "We should redesign lessons X, Y, Z"

### 3.2 Scenario: Identify Struggling Student Segments

**Task**: Find which student segments need additional support.

**Steps**:

1. Review the student clusters from MLflow analysis
2. Examine detailed segment characteristics

**Validation Queries**:

```sql
-- Find the "Struggling Students" segment details
SELECT
    uc.cluster,
    CASE uc.cluster
        WHEN 0 THEN 'High Performers'
        WHEN 1 THEN 'Active Learners'
        WHEN 2 THEN 'Struggling Students'
        WHEN 3 THEN 'Casual Users'
    END as segment_name,
    COUNT(*) as user_count,
    ROUND(AVG(up.avg_score), 1) as avg_score,
    ROUND(AVG(up.total_assessments), 1) as avg_assessments
FROM babblr_gold.user_clusters uc
JOIN babblr_silver.user_profiles up ON uc.user_id = up.user_id
GROUP BY uc.cluster
ORDER BY avg_score ASC;
```

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Query identifies distinct student segments
- [ ] "Struggling Students" segment has lower avg_score
- [ ] Can quantify how many students are in each segment
- [ ] Can identify characteristics of struggling students (high error rate, few completed lessons)
- [ ] Data supports decision: "We need intervention for X% of students"

### 3.3 Scenario: Analyze Assessment Difficulty

**Task**: Determine if assessments are appropriately calibrated for each CEFR level.

**Validation Queries**:

```sql
-- Check if assessment scores align with expected difficulty
SELECT
    assessment_difficulty,
    COUNT(*) as attempts,
    ROUND(AVG(score), 1) as avg_score,
    ROUND(STDDEV(score), 1) as score_stddev,
    ROUND(AVG(duration_minutes), 1) as avg_duration
FROM babblr_silver.assessment_attempts
GROUP BY assessment_difficulty
ORDER BY
    CASE assessment_difficulty
        WHEN 'A1' THEN 1 WHEN 'A2' THEN 2
        WHEN 'B1' THEN 3 WHEN 'B2' THEN 4
        WHEN 'C1' THEN 5 WHEN 'C2' THEN 6
    END;
```

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Query shows scores by CEFR level
- [ ] A1/A2 levels have higher average scores (easier)
- [ ] C1/C2 levels have lower average scores (harder)
- [ ] Score distribution makes sense (stddev reasonable)
- [ ] Duration increases with difficulty (harder = longer)
- [ ] Can identify if any level is miscalibrated
- [ ] Data supports decision: "B2 assessments may be too easy, need review"

### 3.4 Scenario: Track Content Engagement

**Task**: Identify which conversation topics are most/least engaging.

**Validation Queries**:

```sql
-- Find topics with highest and lowest engagement
SELECT
    topic_id,
    SUM(conversation_count) as total_conversations,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_duration_min), 1) as avg_session_minutes,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_messages_per_conv), 1) as avg_messages,
    ROUND(AVG(avg_error_rate) * 100, 1) as avg_error_rate_pct
FROM babblr_gold.topic_engagement
GROUP BY topic_id
ORDER BY avg_session_minutes DESC;
```

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Query shows engagement metrics by topic
- [ ] Can identify most engaging topics (longest sessions)
- [ ] Can identify least engaging topics (shortest sessions)
- [ ] Error rates vary by topic (some topics harder than others)
- [ ] Data supports decision: "Create more content around topic X, less around Y"

### 3.5 Summary: Training Material Manager Decisions

After completing the use case validation, the Training Material Manager should be able to make these data-driven decisions:

| Decision | Data Source | Example Insight |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Which lessons to redesign | `lesson_effectiveness` | "Grammar/subjunctive has 45% completion, needs simplification" |
| Which students need help | `user_clusters` | "23% of students are in 'Struggling' segment" |
| Assessment calibration | `assessment_attempts` | "B2 assessments have 85% avg score, may be too easy" |
| Content prioritization | `topic_engagement` | "Travel topics have 12min avg session, expand this area" |
| Learning velocity | `cefr_funnel` | "Students progress from A1→A2 in 3 weeks on average" |
| At-risk detection | Segment characteristics | "High error rate + few lessons = intervention needed" |

**Final Use Case Checklist**:

- [ ] All four scenarios executed successfully
- [ ] Each scenario produced actionable insights
- [ ] Data quality sufficient for decision-making
- [ ] Results are reproducible (same data = same insights)
- [ ] Training Material Manager persona validated

---

## Part 4: Error Recovery Validation

### 4.1 Common Error Scenarios

Test that the tutorial handles errors gracefully.

**Scenario: Missing Data Files**

- [ ] If parquet files not uploaded, notebook shows clear error message
- [ ] Error message includes instructions for uploading files
- [ ] Notebook doesn't crash with cryptic Spark errors

**Scenario: Serverless Compute Issues**

- [ ] Notebooks prompt to connect if not connected
- [ ] Can reconnect to Serverless if session times out
- [ ] Session state is restored after reconnection (variables preserved)
- [ ] Clear message if daily quota exceeded (resets next day)

**Scenario: Database Already Exists**
